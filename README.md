# Natural Language Processing of eBooks using Python

## Project Description

This project involves performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) on eBooks to analyze text data. The goal is to extract useful information from the text, such as counting the number of chapters, occurrences of specific words, and performing sentiment analysis. The project demonstrates various NLP techniques using regular expressions and text processing.

## Process

1. **Load the Book:**
   - Read the eBook text file into a Python string for processing.

2. **Chapter Count:**
   - Count the number of chapters using string methods and regular expressions.

3. **Word Occurrences:**
   - Identify sentences containing specific words (e.g., "love") using regular expressions.
   - Count occurrences of specific words in the text and calculate the length of sentences containing these words.

4. **Word Frequency Analysis:**
   - Analyze the most frequently used words in the text.
   - Use regular expressions to extract and count words from the text.

## Technology Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for text processing and analysis.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** For pattern matching and text extraction.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For writing and executing code in an interactive environment.

## What I Learned

- **Text Processing:**
  - Gained experience in loading and processing large text files.
  - Learned to use string methods and regular expressions for text analysis.

- **Pattern Matching:**
  - Developed skills in using regex for identifying patterns and extracting information from text.

- **Word Frequency Analysis:**
  - Acquired knowledge in analyzing word frequency and understanding text data.

## Future Insights

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Integrate sentiment analysis to gauge the overall sentiment of the text.
  - Use libraries like `TextBlob` or `NLTK` to perform advanced sentiment analysis.

- **Advanced Text Analysis:**
  - Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and part-of-speech tagging.

- **Visualization:**
  - Create visualizations (e.g., word clouds) to represent word frequencies and other text statistics.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Optimize text processing for large eBooks and handle different formats.
